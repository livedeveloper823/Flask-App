How to setup:
Install Python 3.9 (not the latest version 3.10+ as that won't work) if it is not already installed: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.13/python-3.9.13-amd64.exe
Make sure you check the "Add Python to PATH" box when you run the installer

Install Chrome if not already installed: https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/

Install Windows Terminal from the Windows store

Extract the files from the zip to a new folder.

Set bet365 account username, password, bet365_url and Rebel Betting email and password in rebel_placer.ini. Change minimum_value_percentage, maximum_value_percentage & max_stake to match the settings you have on Rebel.

Run "Start Rebel placers.bat", this will start Chrome windows for all the placers.

If you only want to use one account, delete 2.ini.

To set up multiple accounts, copy and paste 2.ini and rename it to 3.ini. Change the bet365 account in 3.ini, close windows terminal and run "Start Rebel placers.bat" again. Repeat for 4.ini and so on.
